# Hate_Speech_detection
Hate speech is a big problem on the internet, it can be found on many platforms like social media, comment sections, and online forms. So, detecting hate speech is helpful to prevent harmful effects on society. Here, we used **machine learning algorithms** to identify text and hate speech. We applied **Natural Language Processing(NLP)** techniques and built machine learning models for classification.

*Dataset: We used the Twitter dataset from Kaggle for this project.*

**This project will help us to identify if the communication contains hatred or offensive language towards a person.** 
**It can detect and classify hate speech in private messages, comments, and social media posts.**

**Tools used: Python [NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn], Decision Tree Classifier, NLP**
